# Odin-Recipe Webpage

## Project Description

This project is a simple and user-friendly recipe webpage built with HTML and CSS. It features a visually appealing hero image on the main page and includes four different recipes, each with its own dedicated page.

## Features

- **Main Page**: The main page showcases a hero image and presents four different recipes. Each recipe is clickable and redirects to its own dedicated page.
- **Recipe Pages**: Each recipe page provides detailed directions on how to prepare the dish. The instructions are clear, easy to follow, and suitable for cooks of all levels.

## Usage

To view the recipes, simply click on the desired recipe on the main page. This will redirect you to the dedicated page for that recipe where you can view the detailed cooking instructions.

## Future Improvements

Future updates will aim to include more diverse recipes and improve the overall user experience.
